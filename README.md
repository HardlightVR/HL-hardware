Plastic part files, textile patterns, cable assembly, non-electronics BOM, and assembly instructions for the Hardlight suit.

### Organization
 - Prototype Plastics: CAD files for plastics used in low quantity release. You may find these easier to 3D print. 
 - Final Plastics: CAD files used for final 500 release, with DFM improvements for injection molding. 
 - Fabrics: MKII fabric patterns, sewing instructions, and BOM. See **Manufacturing** for why these aren't MKIII patterns.
 - Cables: Cable assembly drawings, BOM, assembly and insertion instructions.
 - Backpack adapters: 3D printable designs for the Hardlight backpack adapter for MSI, Zotac and HP Omen VR backpack computers. 

### Manufacturing
Hardlight VR was a complex project involving many dependencies, which goes doubly for our hardware processes. Sub contractors may have different capabilities based on their location, and in several cases, we deferred the final version of items like our fabric patterns and BOM to our Chinese factoryâ€™s discretion to avoid last minute assembly line and procurement issues. For this reason, we have only included the final version of the MKII patterns and BOM, which were created in the USA. 

If you are creating a Hardlight suit, you may want to revise elements such as the arm strap components to better match the final Hardlight version. Additionally, review all plastics beforehand to ensure they correctly fit with the system. The plastics in this repo are designed for injection molding, not 3D printing, but we have included a slightly older version that will hopefully prove less problematic to create. 

### Contributing and Contact
We welcome any and all interest in derivative projects made from these designs, edits to the designs, and updates to the BOM and assembly diagrams! If you are interested in contributing to the public Hardlight repositories, please create an issue, or email hardlightvr@gmail.com.
